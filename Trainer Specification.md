# MORSE CODE TRAINER SPECS



1. Send the first two letters, i.e. a b, few times to get the used to the sound.
2. Then send a set of those two letters, i.e. a b, randomly in blocks of five characters like a b a b b for five times.
3. Repeat the above without showing the letter.
4. Repeat the above but this time allowed key-stroke input. Display the input on screen then average the result. If less than 90% accuracy, start from point 1 again.
5. If 90%+ accuracy achieved, then add a letter, i.e. c, to the previous set, but still sending in blocks of five characters.
6. When reached the end of alphabet, start to add numbers to the sequence and repeat the process.
7. Able to adjust WPM speed.
8. Able to adjust pitch tone.
9. Able to receive input from morse-key and determine the character sent.
